This repository holds my solutions to the 3 Coding Challenges: The Puzzle, The Interface & The Database.

The solutions for The Puzzle and The Database can be found within this repository itself while the solution for The Interface are in two different repositories.


## 1. The Puzzle

## 2. The Interface
As mentioned above, the solution for this coding challenge is split into two different repos:

 - [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Munaiz123/SatoshiNakamoto_Frontend)
 - [Backend Repository](https://github.com/Munaiz123/SatoshiNakamoto_Backend)

Although the coding challenge only asks for the user interface, I felt adding a backend to the solution better represents my skills as a full stack software engineer as it relates to React and Cloud(AWS) technologies. Further implementation details for each component can be found in their respective repositories. 

## 3. The Database
