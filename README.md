This repository holds my solutions to the 3 Coding Challenges: The Puzzle, The Interface & The Database.

The solutions for The Puzzle and The Database can be found within this repository itself while the solution for The Interface are in two different repositories(linked below).


## 1. The Puzzle
The entry point for the solution for this problem is in ```./The_Puzzle/index.js```.  However, this is an incomplete solution. 

The overview/steps to solve the problem is my own work but I used to Chat GPT (3.5) to generate the code for the helper functions and determining the probabilities of each potential poker hand to pursue.

I also used GPT to generate the switch statement function in ```./The_Puzzle/MulliganCards.js```. I left this file incomplete due to time but I've left some comments/psuedocode for each poker hand case, albeit I didn't consider edge cases. 

But overall, ```./The_Puzzle/README.md``` holds my genral thought process and steps I would take to solve this problem.

## 2. The Interface
Although the coding challenge only asks for a user interface, I felt adding a backend to the solution better represents my skills as a full stack software engineer as it relates to web development and cloud technologies(AWS).

As mentioned previously, the solution for this coding challenge is split into two different repos; implementation details for each component can be found in their respective repositories:

 - [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Munaiz123/SatoshiNakamoto_Frontend)
 - [Backend Repository](https://github.com/Munaiz123/SatoshiNakamoto_Backend)

## 3. The Database
The solution for The Database can be found within this repository under ```The_Database``` folder. There you'll find two seperate ```.md``` files for each part of The Databse question.
